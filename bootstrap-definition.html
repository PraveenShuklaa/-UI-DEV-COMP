  <h1>What is BOOTSTRAP?</h1>
  <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web 
      development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, 
      navigation and other interface components.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap is a web framework that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages 
        (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's 
        choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the 
        developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides 
        basic style definitions for all HTML elements. </p>
