  <h1>What is JAVASCRIPT?</h1>
  <p>JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, 
      object-oriented programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript 
      has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript 
        enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
         use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
